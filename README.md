# Hull-performance-analysis

An end to end analysis on Hull performance dataset was performed to analyse the performance of a hull over a period of time. I have mentioned the key deliverables that I have achieved out of this project.

1. The ship monitoring data includes a variety of parameters essential in developing and exploring vessel performance trends.
2. Outliers and misentries were detected and removed.
3. Dataset was cleaned and transformed as per the needs.
4. Key performance indicators were identified.
5. The significance in difference of performance of the ship over time was analysed.
6. A time series forecasting model was developed to predict the performance of the ship over time.
7. Additional analysis and insights were provided by drilling down the data further.
8. All results were documented in the form of a Powerpoint presentation.
